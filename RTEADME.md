## Lazy Load Sections for WordPress :scroll: (Requires Javascript) :computer:

This WordPress plugin adds a lazy loading effect to sections on your website, improving initial page load speed! :zap:  **But wait, there's a catch!** :thinking:  This plugin only works if Javascript is enabled in the user's browser. :bulb:

**Installation:** :package:

1. Upload the plugin folder (`lazy-load-sections`) to your WordPress plugins directory.
2. Activate the plugin from the WordPress admin panel.  :heavy_check_mark:

**How to Use:**  :question:

1. Add the class `lazy-load-on` to any section you want to lazy load. This will initially hide the section. :eye_in_speech_bubble:
2. The plugin will automatically detect when the section enters the viewport and remove the `lazy-load-on` class, making the section visible. :tada: 

**Notes:** ⚠️

* This plugin relies on Javascript. If Javascript is disabled, the lazy loading effect won't work, but the sections will still be displayed. :information_source:
* This plugin requires jQuery to function.  Make sure your theme includes jQuery or another compatible library.  :warning:

**I hope this plugin helps you improve your website's performance! :muscle:**
